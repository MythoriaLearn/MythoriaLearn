        <h2>1. A Trip to Yogyakarta</h2>
        <p>
          Last year, my friends and I went to Yogyakarta. We spent our holiday
          there. We went to Yogyakarta by train. The train schedule from Malang
          was at 03.00 PM and arrived in Yogyakarta at 11.00 PM.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          After we arrived at the train station in Yogyakarta, we took a taxi to
          our hotel at Prawirotaman street. The hotel name was Duta Hotel. After
          we checked in to the hotel, we prepared ourselves for the tour in
          Yogyakarta for 3 days.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          On the first day, we went to the Sultan Palace, Tamansari Water Castle
          and Alun-Alun Kidul. We learned a lot about the history of Sultanate
          and its culture. After visiting Tamansari, we walked to Alun-Alun
          Kidul, the southern city square of Yogyakarta. We tried to walk
          between two beringin (banyan) trees with our eyes closed. It was said
          that if we could walk straight between the trees, our wishes would
          come true.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          On the second day, we went to Malioboro Street. We did a lot of
          shopping for batik clothes and souvenirs. We also enjoyed delicious
          Yogyakarta foods like gudeg and bakpia. At night, we went to Prambanan
          Temple to watch Ramayana Ballet. It was an amazing traditional dance
          performance.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          On the last day, we went to Borobudur Temple. We took many pictures
          there. The temple was so magnificent. After visiting Borobudur, we
          went back to the hotel to take our luggage and went to the train
          station.

        <h2>2. A Memorable Trip to a Traditional Village</h2>
        <p>
          Last year, I had the opportunity to visit a traditional village in the
          highlands with my family. We had heard so much about the village’s
          unique culture and traditions, so we were excited to finally
          experience it ourselves.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The journey to the village was long and winding, but the views along
          the way were breathtaking. As we drove higher into the mountains, the
          air became fresher, and we could see terraced rice fields stretching
          across the hillsides. When we finally arrived, we were greeted by the
          warm smiles of the villagers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The village was like a place out of a storybook. The houses were made
          of bamboo and wood, with thatched roofs that gave them a rustic charm.
          We spent our first day exploring, walking along narrow paths that led
          to lush gardens and small, serene rivers. We learned that the
          villagers still practiced many of their ancient customs, and we were
          invited to join them in their daily routines.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          One of the highlights of our visit was participating in a traditional
          dance performance. The villagers taught us the steps, and though it
          was challenging, it was a lot of fun. We laughed at our mistakes, but
          the villagers were patient and encouraging. Later, we were treated to
          a delicious meal made from local ingredients. It was amazing to taste
          dishes that had been passed down through generations.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As the sun began to set, we gathered around a fire, listening to
          stories about the village’s history and legends. It felt magical to be
          part of such an authentic cultural experience, far from the hustle and
          bustle of the city.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          That trip to the traditional village was truly unforgettable. Not only
          did we learn about a different way of life, but we also formed a
          special bond with the people we met. I hope to visit again someday and
          immerse myself in that peaceful, beautiful village once more.

        <h2>3. A Day at the Hidden Beach</h2>
        <p>
          Last summer, my friends and I discovered a hidden beach while
          exploring the coast. It was an unplanned adventure, and none of us had
          any idea that we would stumble upon such a beautiful place.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We had heard about a secluded beach from some locals, so we decided to
          try to find it. After hiking through a narrow trail covered with thick
          trees and bushes, we finally saw a glimpse of the ocean. As we got
          closer, we were stunned by the sight in front of us. The beach was
          completely deserted, with soft, white sand stretching along the
          shoreline and clear blue water sparkling under the sun.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We couldn’t believe our luck! The whole beach felt like it was just
          for us. We quickly set up our things and ran toward the water. The
          ocean was cool and refreshing, perfect for a hot summer day. We spent
          hours swimming, playing games in the water, and just relaxing on the
          sand. The sound of the waves and the peace of the secluded spot made
          everything feel almost dreamlike.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          At noon, we gathered around for a small picnic we had packed earlier.
          We shared sandwiches, fruit, and cold drinks, laughing and talking as
          we enjoyed our meal. The peaceful surroundings made it feel like we
          were miles away from the rest of the world.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As the day came to an end, we watched the sun set over the horizon,
          painting the sky with shades of pink, orange, and purple. It was a
          beautiful moment that we all shared in silence, feeling grateful for
          the amazing day we had.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          That trip to the hidden beach is one of my favorite memories. We
          didn’t plan it, but it turned out to be the best day of our summer.
          I’ll never forget the feeling of being in such a beautiful place with
          my closest friends, surrounded by nature and peace.
